def icharger208b(source):
    """Read data from an iCharger 208B battery charger.

    Logs data events emitted by the charger during charge, discharge, etc.  Likely works with other
    models from iCharger, but this is untested.  Consider :ref:`submitting-feedback` to let us know.

    This model battery charger comes with USB cable that provides serial-over-USB communication with
    the host computer.  To connect with the charger, you'll need to open a handle to the appropriate
    serial port, which will vary between platforms and based on the number and configuration of devices
    currently connected.

    Examples
    --------

    Open a serial port on a Mac OSX computer and connect the charger object:

    >>> fobj = serial.serial_for_url("/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART", baudrate=128000)
    >>> pipe = pipecat.device.charger.icharger208b(fobj)

    Retrieve records from the charger during charging:

    >>> for record in pipe:
    ...   print record

    Parameters
    ----------
    fobj: file-like object, typically an instance of :class:`serial.Stream`

    Yields
    ------
    records
        Records will contain information including the charge mode, supply
        voltage, battery voltage, battery current, internal and external
        charger temperature, and the total charged added-to / removed-from the
        battery.
